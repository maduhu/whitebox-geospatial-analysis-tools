'''
This script is an example of a plugin script, complete with 
integration within Whitebox's tool tree panel, and a dialog
for retrieving user-specified parameters. The main work of 
the tool is performed on a seperate thread that is able to 
communitcate with the main Whitebox user interface, e.g. by 
updating progress and responding to the user's selection of 
the cancel button.

The script is not intended to be run, so much as it is meant 
for demonstrating how you can maniputlate geographical data 
within Whitebox. Python is an excellent language to use to 
quickly develop a plugin tool in Whitebox. It's particularly 
useful if you simply want to automate a workflow by calling
other existing tools. One issue with the use of Python however
is that it does not have the performance that you get with 
Java and Groovy. A good alternative is to create your script
using the Groovy language with static compilation. This gets
you performance very nearly matching that of Java while still
getting the benefits of a scripting type language's terse 
syntax, ideal for rapid plugin tool development. You'll find
plenty of examples of plugins developed using Groovy.

Notice that for a script to appear in the Whitebox toolbox,
it must be saved within the Scripts folder within the 
Plugins and resources directories. You will also need to
relaunch Whitebox before it appears in the toolbox. Any changes
that you make to the script will be live however, meaning that
you can modify a script and then run it immediately afterwards.
