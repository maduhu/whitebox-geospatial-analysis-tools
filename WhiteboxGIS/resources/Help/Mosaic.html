<h1>Mosaic</h1>

<p>This tool will create an image mosaic from one or more <i>input image
files</i> using one of three resampling methods including, nearest neighbour,
bilinear interpolation, and cubic convolution.The order of the input source
image files is important. Grid cells in the output image will be assigned the
corresponding value determined from the <i>first</i> image found in the list to
possess an overlapping co-ordinate.</p>

<p>The <i>Nearest neighbour</i> resampling approach assigns each grid cell in
the destination image the value of the nearest grid cell corresponding the the
same x- y- coordinates in the source images. The <i>Bilinear</i> resampling
method interpolates a new value based on the nearest four grid cells in one of
the source images. The <i>Cubic convolution</i> resampling method interpolates
a new value based on the nearest 16 grid cells in one of the source images.
Notice that only the <i>Nearest neighbour</i> method is appropriate with
categorical data, while the other two approaches often give better results for
data on a continuous scale. The <i>Nearest neighbour</i> method is the fastest
of the three, followed by <i>Bilinear</i>, followed by <i>Cubic
convolution</i>, which is comparably slow in operation.</p>

<p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values are ignored during resampling. Notice that if
the <b><i>Bilinear</i></b> or <b><i>Cubic convolution</i></b> resampling
methods are selected, the destination image should be of the <i>float</i> data
type and <i>continuous</i> data scale as the output will contain floating-point
values (i.e. decimal numbers).</p>

<h2 class="SeeAlso"><i>Resample</i> Versus <i>Mosaic</i></h2>

<p><b><i><a href="Resample.html">Resample</a></i></b> is very similar in
operation to the <b><i>Mosaic</i></b> tool. The <b><i>Resample</i></b> tool
should be used when there is an existing image into which you would like to
dump information from one or more source images. If the source images are more
extensive than the destination image, i.e. there are areas that extend beyond
the destination image boundaries, these areas will not be represented in the
updated image. Grid cells in the destination image that are not overlapping
with any of the input source images will not be updated, i.e. they will possess
the same value as before the resampling operation. The <b><i>Mosaic</i></b>
tool is used when there is no existing destination image. In this case, a new
image is created that represents the bounding rectangle of each of the two or
more input images. Grid cells in the output image that do not overlap with any
of the input images will be assigned the <b><i>NoData</i></b> value.</p>
