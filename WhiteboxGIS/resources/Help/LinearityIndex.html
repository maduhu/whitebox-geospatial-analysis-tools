        <h1>Linearity index</h1>

        <p>This tool calculates the linearity index of polygon features based on a 
            regression analysis. The index is simply coefficient of determination 
            (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>) calculated from a regression analysis of the 
            <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of either all of the grid cells 
            within a polygon (in the case of a raster input) or the exterior 
            hull nodes of a vector polygon. Linearity index is a measure of how 
            well a polygon can be described by a straight line. It is a related 
            index to the 
            <a href="ElongationRatio.html"><b><i>Elongation Ratio</i></b></a>, 
            but is much more efficient to calculate as it does not require 
            finding the 
            <a href="MinimumBoundingBox.html"><b><i>Minimum Bounding Box</i></b></a>. 
            Also, linearity can be calculated for raster data, whereas the 
            elongation ratio tool only accepts vector inputs. The Pearson 
            correlation coefficient between linearity index and the 
            elongation ratio for a large data set of lake polygons in northern 
            Canada was found to be 0.656, suggesting a moderate level of 
            association between the two measures of polygon linearity. Note that 
            this index is not useful for identifying narrow yet sinuous polygons, 
            such as meandering rivers. 
        </p>

        <p>The tool works for either raster or vector input files. If a raster 
            file is input, the grid should contain polygons with unique 
            identifiers. Raster input files also require the name of the output 
            raster file (where the linearity will be assigned to each 
            feature in the input file) and the specified option of outputting 
            text. If a vector shapefile is specified as the input file, the only 
            required input is the name of the file. The linearity values 
            calculated for each vector polygon feature will be placed in the 
            accompanying database file (.dbf) as a new field (LINEARITY). The 
            resulting database file will be automatically displayed after the 
            tool has completed.</p>

        <p>For most polygons, the results will be based on reduced major axis (RMA) 
            regression line, although ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression is used 
            when a polygon is nearly vertically or horizontally aligned.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>

            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                inputFile = wd + "polygons.shp" # vector input<br>
                outputFile = "" # ignored for vector input<br>

        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
