        <h1>Extract valleys (lower quartile)</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to extract channel networks from digital elevation models (DEMs) based on the 
            Lindsay (2006) 'lower-quartile' method. The algorithm is a type of 'valley recognition' method. Other 
            channel mapping methods, such as the <a href="ExtractValleysJohnstonAndRosenfeld.html">Johnston and 
                Rosenfeld (1975) algorithm</a>, experience problems because channel profiles are not always ?v?-shaped, 
            nor are they always apparent in small 3 x 3 windows. The lower-quartile method was developed as an 
            alternative and more flexible valley recognition channel mapping technique. The lower-quartile method 
            operates by running a filter over the DEM that calculates the percentile value of the centre cell with 
            respect to the distribution of elevations within the filter window. The roving window is circular, the 
            diameter of which should reflect the topographic variation of the area (e.g. the channel width or average 
            hillslope length). The user specifies the filter size, in pixels, and this value should be an odd number 
            (e.g. 3, 5, 7, etc.). The appropriateness of the selected window diameter will depend on the grid 
            resolution relative to the scale of topographic features. Cells that are within the lower quartile of the 
            distribution of elevations of their neighbourhood are flagged. Thus, the algorithm identifies grid cells 
            that are in relatively low topographic positions at a local scale. This approach to channel mapping is 
            only appropriate in fluvial landscapes. In regions containing numerous lakes and wetlands, the algorithm 
            will pick out the edges of features.</p>
        <p>This method is best applied to DEMs that are relatively smooth and do not exhibit high levels of 
            short-range roughness. As such, it may be desirable to use a 
            <a href="FilterGaussian.html">smoothing filter</a> before applying this tool.</p>
        <p>This method of extracting valley networks results in line networks that can be wider than a single grid 
            cell. It is often desirable to thin the resulting network using a line-thinning algorithm. The 
            option to perform line-thinning is provided by the tool as a post-processing step.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                demFile = wd + "DEM.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                filterSize = "11"<br>
                lineThinning = "true"<br>
                args = [demFile, outputFile, filterSize, lineThinning]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ExtractValleysLowerQuartile", args, False)<br>
            </code>

        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def demFile = wd + "DEM.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                def filterSize = "11"<br>
                def lineThinning = "true"<br>
                String[] args = [demFile, outputFile, filterSize, lineThinning]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ExtractValleysLowerQuartile", args, false)<br>
