<h1>Extract streams</h1>

<p>
This tool can be used to extract, or map, the likely stream cells from an input 
flow-accumulation image. The algorithm applies a threshold to the input flow 
accumulation image such that streams are considered to be all grid cells with 
accumulation values greater than the specified threshold. As such, this threshold 
represents the minimum area (area is used here as a surrogate for discharge) 
required to initiate and maintain a channel. Smaller threshold values result in 
more extensive stream networks and vice versa. Unfortunately there is very little 
guidance regarding an appropriate method for determining the channel initiation 
area threshold. As such, it is frequently determined either by examining map or 
imagery data or by experimentation until a suitable or desirable channel network 
is identified. Notice that the threshold value will be unique for each landscape 
and dataset (including source and grid resolution), further complicating its 
<i>a priori</i> determination. There is also evidence that in some landscape the 
threshold is a combined upslope area-slope function.</p>
<p>The input background value can either be a numeric value (e.g. 0) or the string 
    "NoData". If "NoData" is input, the background will display transparently.</p>
