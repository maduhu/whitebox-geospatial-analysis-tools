<h1>Flow modelling tools</h1>

<p>There are a number of tools available in Whitebox GAT that can be used to
extract information about the distribution of water and other flow-related
phenomena (e.g. sediment and nutrients) across a landscape. These tools utilize
digital elevation model (DEM) based flow routing algorithms in order to trace
the flowpath from each grid cell in a raster DEM to an outlet point, usually at
the edge of the DEM. Common applications include mapping the spatial
distribution of upslope contributing areas, watershed boundaries, subbasins,
and stream networks from DEM data. These data are also useful for calculating a
number of secondary terrain attributes such as the topographic <a
href="WetnessIndex.html">wetness index</a> (used in the TOPMODEL hydrological
framework) and the <a href="RelativeStreamPower.html">relative stream power
index</a> (sometimes used for modelling erosion and deposition patterns). Most
of these applications require a DEM that has been hydrologically 'corrected' to
remove topographic depressions and flat areas, which can artificially truncate
flowpaths. Available tools for hydrological pre-processing DEM data include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="BreachDeps.html">Depressions breaching</a></li>
  <li><a href="FillDeps.html">Depression filling</a></li>
  <li><a href="FillDepsBySize.html">Depression filling by size</a></li>
  <li><a href="BurnStreams.html">Stream burning</a></li>
  <li><a href="RemoveSingleCellPits.html">Removal of single-cell pits (by
    filling)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Many tools involving tracing flowpaths through a DEM grid require an input
of a flow-pointer grid. A flow-pointer grid contains information about where
the flow entering each grid cell should be directed, i.e. flow-direction data.
In fact, there are several different ways of estimating the flow-pointer grid
depending on the flow algorithm that is chosen. Although there are many
different flow algorithms that have been developed, each can be classified as
either being a single-flow-direction (SFD) algorithm or a
multiple-flow-direction (MFD) algorithm depending on whether or not flow
dispersion is permitted. MFD algorithms will route the flow enter a grid cell
to one or more downslope neighbours. Available tools for creating a
flow-pointer grid include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8, O'Callaghan and Mark's (1984) commonly
    used SFD algorithm</a></li>
  <li><a href="FlowPointerRho8.html">Rho8, J. Fairfield and P. Leymarie's
    (1991) stochastic SFD algorithm</a></li>
  <li><a href="FlowPointerFD8.html">FD8, Freeman's (1991) and Quinn et al.'s
    (1991; 1995) MFD algorithm, commonly used with TOPMODEL</a></li>
  <li><a href="FlowPointerDinf.html">Dinf (D-infinity), Tarboton's (1997) MFD
    algorithm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The decision to use one algorithm over another depends largely on the
application. For example, many applications that involve stream network
analysis require the D8 SFD method because divergence of flow is relatively
rare once water is channelized, greatly simplifying the analysis. When
modelling the pattern of upslope contributing area or soil wetness on
hillslopes, however, flow dispersion may well occur, in which case an MFD flow
algorithm such as Dinf will likely provide more suitable results.</p>

<p>Many applications of flow modelling require the estimation of upslope
contributing area. This is a flow accumulation operation. Most flow algorithm
actually measure the flow accumulation to an area, i.e. a grid cell, rather
than a point (interestingly points have no contributing areas because the are
infinitely small). Because the pattern of contributing area is dependent on the
grid resolution, it is common to normalize this pattern by the resoluton,
effectively yielding the upslope contriubting area per unit contour length,
called the Specific Catchment Area (SCA). Each of the above flow-pointer
algorithms have corresponding flow-accumulation tools, including <a
href="D8FlowAccum.html">D8/Rho8</a>, <a href="FD8FlowAccum.html">FD8</a>, and
<a href="DinfFlowAccum.html">Dinf</a>. </p>

<p>In addition to flow accumulation, common operations that include flow
modelling include <a href="Watershed.html">watershed</a> delineation and many
<a href="StreamTools.html">stream network analysis</a> operations.</p>
