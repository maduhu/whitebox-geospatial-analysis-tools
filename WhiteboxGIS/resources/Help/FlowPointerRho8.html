<h1>Rho8 flow pointer (direction)</h1>

<p>This tool is used to generate a flow pointer grid (i.e. flow direction)
using the stochastic Rho8 (J. Fairfield and P. Leymarie, 1991) algorithm. Like
the <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 flow algorithm</a>, Rho8 is a
single-flow-direction (SFD) method because the flow entering each grid cell is
routed to only one downslope neighbour, i.e. flow divergence is not permitted.
The user must specify the name of a digital elevation model (DEM) that has been
hydrologically corrected to remove all spurious depressions and flat areas. DEM
pre-processing is usually achived using the <a href="FillDeps.html">Fill
Depressions tool</a>.</p>

<p>In Whitebox GAT, Rho8 flow pointers use the following clockwise, base-2
numeric naming convention:</p>

<p>Thus, a grid cell that flows to the northwest will be assigned a '64' in the
Rho8 flow pointer raster. Notice that grid cells that have no lower neighbours
are assigned a flow direction of zero. In a DEM that has been pre-precessed to
remove all depressions and flat areas, this condition will only occur along the
edges of the grid.</p>

<p>The Rho8 flow algorithm was developed to compensate for a directional bias
in the simpler D8 flow algorithm that leads to an abundance of
unnatural-looking areas of parallel flow on certain hillslopes. The Rho8 method
is however stochastic, meaning that each time the tool is run, a slightly
different flow-pointer grid will be produced. This can be a highly undesirable
characteristic, which has led to the unpopularity of this flow-routing method
for widespread applications. </p>

<p>Grid cells possessing the <i><b>NoData</b></i> value in the input DEM are
assigned the <i><b>NoData</b></i> value in the output image. The output raster
is of the <i>integer</i> data type and <i>categorical</i> data scale.</p>
