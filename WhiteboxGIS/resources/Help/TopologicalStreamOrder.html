        <h1>Topological stream order</h1>

        <p>
            This tool can be used to assign the topological stream order to each link in 
            a stream network. According to this stream numbering system, the link directly   
            draining to the outlet is assigned an order of one. Each of the two tributaries 
            draining to the order-one link are assigned an order of two, and so on until 
            the most distant link from the catchment outlet has been assigned an order. The 
            topological order can therefore be thought of as a measure of the topological 
            distance of each link in the network to the catchment outlet and is likely to 
            be related to travel time.</p>
            
        <p>Stream order is often used in hydro-geomorphic 
            and ecological studies to quantify the relative size and importance of a stream 
            segment to the overall river system. Unlike some other stream ordering systems, 
            e.g. <a href="StreamOrder.html">Horton-Strahler stream order</a> and
            <a href="StreamMagnitude.html">Shreve's stream magnitude</a>, topological stream 
            ordering method increases from the catchment outlet towards the channel heads. 
            This has the main advantage that the catchment outlet is likely to be 
            accurately located while the channel network extent may be less accurately mapped.</p>
            
        <p>The user must specify the names of a streams raster image and 
            <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 pointer</a> image. Stream cells are 
            designated in the streams image as all positive, nonzero values. Thus all 
            non-stream or background grid cells are commonly assigned either zeros or 
            <b><i>NoData</i></b> values. The pointer image is used to traverse the 
            stream network and should only be created using the 
            <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 algorithm</a>. Background cells will be 
            assigned the <b><i>NoData</i></b> value in the output image. The output 
            raster is of an <i>integer</i> data type and <i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                streamsFile = wd + "streams.dep"<br>
                pointerFile = wd + "D8 pointer.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                args = [streamsFile, pointerFile, outputFile]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("TopologicalStreamOrder", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def streamsFile = wd + "streams.dep"<br>
                def pointerFile = wd + "D8 pointer.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                String[] args = [streamsFile, pointerFile, outputFile]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("TopologicalStreamOrder", args, false)<br>
            </code>
