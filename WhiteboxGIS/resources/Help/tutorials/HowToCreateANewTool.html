        <div><h1>Creating Whitebox GAT plugin tools</h1>
            <h2><br>By John Lindsay, Ph.D. (Last modified, May 2013)</h2>
            <p><b><i>Please note that this tutorial only applies to Whitebox GAT v. 2.0 
                and higher. The 1.0 series of Whitebox GAT was developed using the 
                .NET framework and not Java.</i></b></p>

            <p>Creating a Whitebox GAT plugin tool can be quite a fast and 
                painless process once you have the steps down. Whitebox tools 
                are generally written in Java, although you can use any 
                programming language targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
                including Scala, Groovy, Jython, and Kotlin. Generally 
                development is made easier if you use an integrated development 
                environment (IDE), such as Netbeans. An IDE is simply an 
                environment for computer programming and there are many very 
                good, free IDEs that are used for Java development. Whitebox has 
                been developed using the Netbeans IDE, which you may want to 
                download and install for this tutorial.</p>
            
            <p>1. Using the Netbeans IDE, create a new Java project. There are a 
                few things that you need to configure before coding the new tool.</p>


            <p>2. First, add a new package called 'plugins' to the 'Source 
                Packages' (right-click over 'Source Packages' and select 
                'Java Package').</p>
            
            <p>3. Now add a new Java class to 'plugins'...call it whatever you will, 
                but this name will be important for other things so you should 
                put some thought into it. It should be relatively short, contain 
                no spaces or numbers, and should be descriptive of what the tool 
                does (unlike the 'MyTool' tool in the example above!). Notice as 
                well that the Java convention for class names is camel-case, i.e. 
                capitalize the first letter and any concatenated words.</p>

            <p>4. Add a new folder called 'META-INF/services' to the source 
                packages. Notice that although you will use the path separator, 
                it will appear as a dot in 'Source Packages'. Letter case is 
                important here.</p>

            <p>5. Within 'META-INF/services', add a new FILE called 
                'whitebox.interfaces.WhiteboxPlugin'. Open this file and enter a 
                line for your new plugin tool, e.g. plugins.MyTool for the 
                MyTool plugin tool. You can have as many plugin tools within the 
                plugins package as you like but each of them need to have a 
                'plugin.' line entry in this file in order to be visible as a 
                plugin to the main Whitebox GUI.</p>

            <p>6. You will likely need to add the WhiteboxAPI.jar to your Library 
                folder. This file will allow you to read/write Whitebox files and 
                Shapefiles and a number of other important functions.</p>

            <p>7. Now open 'MyTool.java' or whatever file is associated with 
                your newly created tool.</p>

            <p>8. Launch Whitebox GAT, open the dialog for whatever tool is 
                closest to the tool that you are creating and press the 
                'View Code' button on the dialog box. Copy and paste the code 
                from this tool into the java file for your new tool. Be sure to 
                erase anything that may be in the new file before pasting.</p>

            <p>9. There will be a number of quick modifications to the code that 
                you'll need to make now. First, if your new tools doesn't reside 
                within the same package (jar file) as the tool you just pasted the 
                code from, you will need to alter the package statement on the 
                first line; in the example from the image above, the MyTool class 
                would need to have a first line that states, 'package 
                JohnLindsaysTools' in reference to the JohnLindsaysTools.jar 
                file that will be created when I compile my project. You will 
                also need to change the class name at the top so that it matches 
                the name of your new tool (i.e. the name of the java file). Also 
                change the return string within the 'getName' function to this 
                very same name. You also need to change the returns of the 
                'getDescriptiveName' (this is the name that your tool is given 
                in the tools list and tree and can contain spaces, unlike the 
                getName version of the tool name) and the 'getToolDescription' 
                (this is the bit of text that will appear along the status bar 
                when the user clicks on your tool in the tools list or tree).</p>

            <p>10. Unless your tool will occupy the same toolbox as the tool 
                from which you copied the code, you will need to update the 
                'getToolbox' return string array. Your tool can be listed in 
                multiple toolboxes within the tools tree, with each one 
                occupying a cell in this string array. You can find out the 
                names of the various existing toolboxes, or create a new 
                toolbox, by examining/editing the toolbox.xml file contained 
                within the ‘Resources’ folder of Whitebox (itself contained 
                within the ‘lib’ folder). Alternatively you can simply examine 
                the 'getToolbox' returns of a tool contained within the toolbox 
                that you want your new tool to occupy.</p>

            <p>11. The real work done by your tool is contained within the 'run' 
                method of the code. You can learn how to work with Whitebox files 
                simply by examining the code of several existing tools. You will 
                likely notice several similarities in the structures of these 
                tools. For example, the various parameters that will be fed to 
                the program are usually ingested early in the method by assigning 
                the various elements of the 'args' array to variables. Input and 
                output raster images are then generally initialized before 
                performing any sort of analysis. Nearer the end of the 'run' 
                method you will likely find that input/output files are closed 
                and returns are fed back to Whitebox using the 'returnData' 
                function. This function accepts an Object. If the return is a 
                string value containing the full file name, including directory, 
                of a WhiteboxRaster or Shapefile, the Whitebox GUI will 
                automatically display the file in the map area. If it contains 
                a string of data, it will be displayed within the text area of 
                the Whitebox GUI. If it contains a jPanel, the panel will be 
                embedded in a jDialog and displayed by the GUI (e.g. see the 
                'FeatureSpacePlot' tool as an example of this). This is also 
                useful if you want to create a custom dialog for a more 
                complicated plugin tool.</p>

            <p>12. If you examine the source code of several Whitebox tools, you 
                may notice that some of them contain a commented-out main function 
                near the bottom of the code file. This function is used for 
                debugging purposes only. Although most Whitebox plugin tools 
                are not meant to be executed independently from the main GUI 
                (i.e. they are part of plugin libraries), by creating a main 
                function you are able to hard-code input parameters and launch 
                the tool. This provides a convenient means for debugging. Just 
                be sure to comment out or delete this method before including 
                the tool in Whitebox.</p>

            <p>13. Once you are done debugging your new tool, compile the 
                project, find the newly created jar file contained within the 
                projects 'dist' folder and copy it into the 'plugins' folder 
                within Whitebox’s ‘Resources’ folder. Whitebox will now discover 
                your new tool when it launches. If Whitebox is already open, 
                close it and re-launch it. Your new tool should be listed in 
                the specified toolbox(es) within the tools tree and also in the 
                tools list.</p>

            <p>14. The next thing that you have to do is to write the 
                instructions for Whitebox to create a dialog when the user 
                selects your new tool. Most tools in Whitebox use a standard 
                set of input parameters, which are then fed to the plugin tools 
                when the user selects the 'OK' button on the tool dialog. (Note: 
                not all tool need to use a standard dialog and it is possible 
                for you to embed a custom dialog in Whitebox as well by 
                returning a jPanel.) The instructions to draw a tool dialog are 
                contained in an xml file, which is located in the ‘Dialogs’ 
                folder within the 'plugins' folder, and which has the same name 
                as your tool (i.e. the short name, or class name, and not the 
                descriptive name). It’s probably easiest if you find a tool with 
                similar input and output parameters to your own and simply copy 
                and modify its dialog xml file as needed. Importantly, the order 
                of the parameters in this file must match the order in which you 
                ingest the parameters of the 'args' array within the tool's run 
                method.</p>

            <p>15. That's it. Now all you need to do is to create an 
                accompanying help file for your new tool. If you haven't already 
                created one, then when you open the tool's dialog you will 
                notice a button on the lower right-hand side that says 'Create 
                New Help Entry'. If you press this button, you will be presented 
                with another dialog that will allow you to create the html file 
                that will become the tool's associated help file. It will 
                automatically contain the formatting necessary for a Whitebox 
                help entry and will be saved in the appropriate folder for it to 
                be discovered the next time that the dialog is opened.</p>

                <p>Congratulations…you’ve just created a new Whitebox GAT 
                    tool!</p>
