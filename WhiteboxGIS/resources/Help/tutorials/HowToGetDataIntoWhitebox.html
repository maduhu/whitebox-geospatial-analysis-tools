            <h1>How to get data into Whitebox</h1>
            <h2><br>By John Lindsay, Ph.D. (Last modified, May 2013)</h2>
            <p>Okay, so now you have this very cool and powerful GIS at your 
            disposal. But it's not all that useful unless you can get your 
            data into it to play with. So how do you do that? Well the answer 
            depends on the type of data that you have, and here I am referring 
            to raster and vector data. Whitebox's native raster file format is 
            is called the <a href="../FileFormatsDescriptions.html">Whitebox 
                Raster</a> and it is different than the format that you have 
            encountered for raster data in other GIS and remote sensing products. 
            This means that you have to import raster data from other software 
            into Whitebox. The tools within the 'Data Import/Export' toolbox 
            are used to exchange raster data from/to other software. It contains 
            tools for converting some of the most common GIS data formats.</p>
            
            <p>The question that I get asked more than any other is, 'how do I 
            get my raster data from ESRI's ArcGIS into Whitebox?', probably 
            because of the ubiquity of this software in GIS workshops. So it's 
            worth describing how you can do this in detail here. You can exchange 
            raster data between ArcGIS and Whitebox either in ASCII (i.e. text) or 
            binary format. The preferred method is binary because these data 
            are smaller (therefore the import/export operations are quicker) and 
            because it does not significantly alter the original data. The tool 
            for importing ArcGIS rasters is called <a href="../ImportArcGrid.html">
                Import ArcGIS Binary Grid</a> This is the best and easiest way 
            to import raster files from ArcGIS. Floating-point grid files 
            consist of a header file (.hdr) and data files (.flt). The tool can 
            run in batch mode, importing multiple files at one time. Output file 
            names are the same of the input files and are contained within the 
            same directory. Use the <b><i>Raster to Float</i></b> tool in the 
            'Conversion Tools' toolbox of ArcGIS to create floating-point 
            grid files from your ArcGIS raster files.</p>
            
            <p>Getting vector data into Whitebox is generally straight forward. 
            Whitebox's native vector format is the Shapefile (.shp). The shapefile 
            is widely used within the ESRI software platform and is also seen 
            quite widely in other GIS communities as well. In fact, because it 
            is an open formate, often government agencies will distribute their 
            vector GIS data in Shapefile format. As such, there is generally no 
            need to import vector data into Whitebox. If you are using a software 
            package that does not use the Shapefile format as its native vector 
            format, it is quite likely that it has an export tool that will allow 
            you to convert it into a Shapefile.</p>
