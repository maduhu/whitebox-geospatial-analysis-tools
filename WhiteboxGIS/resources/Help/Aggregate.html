        <h1>Aggregate</h1>
        <div>This tool can be used to reduce the grid resolution of a raster 
            by a user specified amount. For example, using an aggregation 
            factor of 2 would result in a raster with half the number of rows 
            and columns. The grid cell values in the output image will consist of 
            the mean, sum, maximum, minimum, or range of the overlapping grid 
            cells in the input raster (four cells in the case of an aggregation 
            factor of 2).</div>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>

        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                inputFile = wd + "DEM filled.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                aggFactor = "2"<br>
                aggType = "mean"<br>
                args = [inputFile, outputFile, aggFactor, aggType]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("Aggregate", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>

        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def inputFile = wd + "DEM filled.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                def aggFactor = "2"<br>
                def aggType = "mean"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFile, outputFile, aggFactor, aggType]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("Aggregate", args, false)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
