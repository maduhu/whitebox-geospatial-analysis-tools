<h1>Isolate raster features by location</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to either isolate or remove polygon features from a raster image based on their 
spatial relationship with the features in a second raster data set. Raster polygon features are defined as 
patches of similar non-zero value. The user must first specify whether polygon features in the input image 
are being isolated or removed. They must then specify the spatial relationship between the input features of 
the two rasters, with options of 1) 'intersect', 2) 'are completely within', 3) 'are within a distance of', 
and 4) 'have their centroids in'. If the 'are within a distance of' relation is selected, the user must 
also specify the distance threshold.</p>
<p>This is the raster equivalent of the <a href="IsolateVectorFeaturesByLocation.html"><b><i>Isolate Vector Features 
By Location</i></b></a> tool, which operates with input vector shapefiles.
