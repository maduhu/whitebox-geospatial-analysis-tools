        <h1>Cost accumulation</h1>

        <p>The <b><i>cost-accumulation</i></b> tool can be used to perform <a
                href="LeastCostAnalysis.html">cost-distance or least-cost pathway</a> analyses.
            Specifically, this tool can be used to calculate the accumulated cost of
            traveling from the 'source grid cell' to each other grid cell in a raster
            dataset. It is based on the costs associated with traveling through each cell
            along a pathway represented in a cost (or friction) surface. If there are
            multiple source grid cells, each cell in the resulting cost-accumulation
            surface will reflect the accumulated cost to the source cell that is connected
            by the minimum accumulated cost-path. The user must specify the names of the
            raster file containing the source cells (<b><i>Input Source Raster</i></b>),
            the raster file containing the cost surface information (<b><i>Input
                    Cost-Friction Raster</i></b>), the output <b><i>Cost-accumulation Surface
                    Raster</i></b>, and the output <b><i>Back-Link Raster</i></b>. Source cells are
            designated as all positive, non-zero valued grid cells in the <b><i>Source
                    Raster</i></b>. The <b><i>Cost (Friction) Raster</i></b> can be created by
            combining the various cost factors associated with the specific problem (e.g.
            slope gradient, visibility, etc.) using the raster calculator or the <b><i><a
                        href="WeightedOverlay.html">Weighted Overlay</a></i></b> tool. While the
            <b><i>Cost-accumulation Surface Raster</i></b> can be helpful for visualizing
            the three-dimensional characteristics of the 'cost landscape', it is actually
            the <b><i>Back-Link Raster </i></b>that is used as inputs to the other two
            cost-distance tools, <b><i>Cost Allocation</i></b> and <b><i>Cost
                    Pathway</i></b>, to determine the least-cost linkages among neighbouring grid
            cells on the cost surface. If the accumulated cost surface is analogous to a
            digital elevation model (DEM) then the <b><i>Back-Link Raster</i></b> is
            equivalent to the <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 flow-direction</a> pointer.
            In fact, it is created in exactly the same way and uses the same convention for
            designating 'flow directions' between neighbouring grid cells. </p>

        <p>The cost of moving through a cell will be considered to be directionally
            invariant (i.e. isotropic; it is the same cost to travel northward through a
            cell as it is to travel eastward) if the user does not specify values for
            either the anisotropic direction or strength. An anisotropic bias can be added
            to the process of calculating the outputs by specifying an anisotropic
            direction (a number between 0 and 360 degrees) and an anisotropic strength (a
            number between -100 and 100).</p>

        <p>The two input grids must have the same dimensions. The algorithm operates in
            an interactive manner. Depending on the size of the input grids and the
            complexity of the cost surface, the tool may take considerable time to
            complete. <b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the input cost surface image are
            ignored during processing and assigned <i><b>NoData</b></i> values in the
            outputs. The output cost accumulation raster is of the <i>float</i> data type
            and <i>continuous</i> data scale. The output back-link raster is of the
            <i>integer</i> data type and the <i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                sourceFile = wd + "source.dep"<br>
                costFile = wd + "cost.dep"<br>
                outCostAccumFile = wd + "cost accum.dep"<br>
                outBackLink = wd + "back link.dep"<br>
                forceDirection = "not specified"<br>
                forceStrength = "not specified<br>
                args = [sourceFile, costFile, outCostAccumFile, outBackLink, forceDirection, forceStrength]<br>

        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
