        <h1>Patch orientation</h1>

        <p>This tool calculates the orientation of polygon features based on a 
            regression analysis. It is the direction component of the 
            <a href="LinearityIndex.html"><b><i>Linearity Index</i></b></a> 
            (i.e. r-squared value). Note that polygons are oriented-type data 
            (e.g. N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE) and that this orientation is 
            expressed as an angle between 0 and 180 degrees clockwise from 
            north. This algorithm works very well at finding the orientation of 
            streamlined features.</p>
        
        <p>The tool works for either raster or vector input files. If a raster 
            file is input, the grid should contain polygons with unique 
            identifiers. Raster input files also require the name of the output 
            raster file (where the patch orientation will be assigned to each 
            feature in the input file) and the specified option of outputting 
            text. If a vector shapefile is specified as the input file, the only 
            required input is the name of the file. The patch orientation values 
            calculated for each vector polygon feature will be placed in the 
            accompanying database file (.dbf) as a new field (ORIENT). The 
            resulting database file will be automatically displayed after the 
            tool has completed.</p>

        <p>For most polygons, the results will be based on reduced major axis (RMA) 
            regression line, although ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression is used 
            when a polygon is nearly vertically or horizontally aligned. Note 
            that this provides a similar measure of polygon direction to that of 
            the elongation direction (ELONG_DIR) output from the 
            <a href="ElongationRatio.html"><b><i>Elongation Ratio</i></b></a> 
            tool. Elongation, is however, based on the calculation of the 
            <a href="MinimumBoundingBox.html"><b><i>Minimum Bounding Box</i></b></a>  
            long-axis rather than linear regression analysis.</p>
