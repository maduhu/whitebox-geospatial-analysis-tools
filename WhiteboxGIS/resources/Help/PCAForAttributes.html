        <h1>PCA for attributes</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) 
            on a group of specified attributes from a vector file. PCA is a common 
            data reduction technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of 
            multi-dimensional data space. Correlation among attributes in the 
            original data set represents data redundancy, i.e. fewer attributes 
            than are present are required to represent the same information, 
            where the information is related to variance within the attributes. 
            PCA transforms the original data set of <i>n</i> attributes into 
            <i>n</i> 'components' variables, where each component is uncorrelated 
            with all other components. The technique works by transforming the axes 
            of the multi-spectral space such that they coincides with the directions 
            of greatest correlation. Each of these new axes are orthogonal to one 
            another. PCA is therefore a type of coordinate system transformation. 
            The PCA components are arranged such that the greatest amount of 
            variance (or information) within the original data set, is contained 
            within the first component and the amount of variance decreases with 
            each component. It is often the case that the majority of the 
            information contained in a multi-dimensional data set can be 
            represented by the first three or four PCA components. The 
            higher-order components are often associated with noise in the 
            original data set.</p>

        <p>The user must specify the name of the input shapefile and the names 
            of the input attributes. Additionally, the user must specify whether 
            to perform a standardized PCA and the number of output components to 
            generate (all components will be output unless otherwise specified; 
            there can be as many components generated as there are input 
            attributes). A standardized PCA is performed using the correlation 
            matrix rather than the variance-covariance matrix. This is 
            appropriate when the variances in the input attributes differ 
            substantially, such as would be the case if they contained values 
            that were recorded in different units (e.g. feet and meters) or 
            on different scales. The tool can output a specified number of 
            components (must be less than the number of variables). If this 
            parameter is not specified (left blank in dialog) all components 
            will be recorded in the output.</p>

        <p>Several outputs will be generated when the tool has completed. A text 
            report will output into the text area at the bottom of the Whitebox 
            user-interface. This report contains useful data and it is advisable  
            to save it for later reference by right-clicking over the text area 
            and selecting 'Save'. The first table that is in the PCA report 
            lists the amount of explained variance (in non-cumulative and 
            cumulative form), the eigenvalue, and the eigenvector for each 
            component. Each of the PCA components refer to the newly created, 
            transformed attribute stored in the shapefile's database file. 
            The amount of explained variance associated with each component 
            can be thought of as a measure of how much information content 
            within the original multi-spectral data set that a component has. 
            The higher this value is, the more important the component is. 
            This same information is presented in graphical form in the 'Scree 
            Plot' that is also output by the tool. Note that you can save the 
            scree plot by right-clicking over the plot and selecting 'Save'. The 
            eigenvalue is another measure of the information content of a 
            component and the eigenvector describes the mathematical 
            transformation (rotation coordinates) that correspond to a 
            particular component image.</p>

        <p><i>Factor Loadings</i> are also output in a table within the PCA text 
            report. These loading values describe the correlation (i.e. <i>r</i> 
            values) between each of the PCA components (columns) and the 
            original attributes (rows). These values show you how the information 
            contained in an attribute is spread among the components. An analysis 
            of factor loadings can be reveal useful information about the 
            data set. For example, it can help to identify groups of similar 
            attributes.</p>

        <p>PCA is used as a data reduction technique and for noise reduction. 
            While this tool is intended to be applied to the attributes of a 
            vector file, PCA can also be performed on imagery data using the

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
