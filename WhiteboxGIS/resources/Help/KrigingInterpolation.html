        <h1>Kriging interpolation</h1>

        <p>
            This tool can be used to interpolate a regular grid raster from a vector 
            points file using a kriging interpolation method. The user must specify the 
            name of the input vector shapefile and the name of the field within the vector's 
            attribute table that is used to indicate height. The output file name, and 
            optionally, the name of the associated error variance file, must also be 
            provided. The user must also provide either the grid resolution of the output 
            surface or the name of an existing raster file from which to derive the 
            geographical extent and grid resolution. If a cell size (grid resolution) is 
            specified, the output raster will derive its geographical extent from that 
            of the input vector points file. The interpolation is based on the values 
            associated with the points contained within a neighbourhood surrounding each 
            grid cell in the output raster. The neighbourhood extent is determined by the 
            <i>number of neighbours</i> parameter.</p>

        <p>Kriging methods use the variogram to determine the interpolation weights. The 
        <b><i>variogram</i></b> measures differences in observed values over a set of separation distance bands, 
        or <b><i>lags</i></b>. The plot of semivariance (a measure of the difference in values) by lag 
        distance derived for a set of point observations is known as the <b><i>experimental variogram</i></b>. 
        In fact, kriging methods do not use this data directly to determine interpolation 
        weights. Instead, a continuous model is fit to these observed data and this forms the 
        basis for weight determination. The continuous model, known as the <b><i>theoretical 
        variogram</i></b>, may take many forms but the three options that are included by this tool 
        include, Gaussian, Exponential, and Spherical models. The models differ largely in the 
        shape of the fitted line, however, each model type has the characteristic that the 
        semivariance starts off low at the shortest lag distances (i.e. near points have 
        similar values) and increases until eventually levelling off. The separation distance 
        at which the variogram levels off is known as the <b><i>range</i></b> or active lag 
        distance. This represents the maximum distance to which spatial autocorrelation 
        is observed within the data set. The semivariance value at which the variogram 
        levels off is known as the <b><i>sill</i></b>. In fact, not all variograms display 
        this characteristic levelling off. Such variograms are referred to as non-transitive. 
        This occurs when the data points do not extend beyond the correlation length of 
        the modelled phenomena. The y-intercept of the variogram model is known as the 
        <b><i>nugget</i></b> or nugget variance. The nugget is assumed to be non-spatial variation, 
        i.e. apparent random noise, resulting from either measurement error or else 
        variation caused by phenomena operating at shorter spatial scales than the minimum 
        separation distance within the sampled data.</p>

        <p>If the characteristics of spatial autocorrelation within the data set are the 
        same in all directions, the variogram is said to be <b><i>isotopic</i></b>. If the data 
        demonstrate a strong directional trend, the same variogram will not apply in all 
        directions. An <b><i>anisotropic</i></b>, or directionally variant, variogram model can 
        be applied by specifying the <b><i>angle</i></b>, <b><i>tolerance</i></b>, and 
        <b><i>band width</i></b> parameters within an anisotropic variogram model.</p>

        <p>Generally, the process of deriving a theoretical variogram model for use in 
        kriging requires a certain amount of experimentation. It is an iterative 
        process that requires modifying the model type, number of lags, and lag size 
        in order to achieve the best possible fit. The kriging interpolation tool allows 
        users to interactively adjust these input parameters and to view the variogram 
        and variogram surface map before running the interpolation.</p>
