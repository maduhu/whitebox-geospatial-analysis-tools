        <h1>Exposure towards a wind flux</h1>

        <p>This tool creates a new raster in which each grid cell is assigned 
            the exposure of the land-surface to a hypothetical wind flux. It can 
            be conceptualized as the angle between a plane orthogonal to the wind 
            and a plane that represents the local topography at a grid cell 
            (Böhner and Antonic, 2007). The user must specify the name of an 
            input slope raster file (created using the <b><i>Slope</i></b> tool), 
            an input aspect raster file (created using the <b><i>Aspect</i></b> 
            tool), an azimuth value (i.e. a wind direction), and optionally an 
            input maximum upwind slope raster file (created using the 
            <a href="HorizonAngle.html"><b><i>Horizon Angle</i></b></a> tool). 
            Notice that the specified azimuth represents a regional wind direction. 
            The algorithm works in two modes: 1) exposure is measured to the 
            horizontal component of the wind, and 2) exposure is measured to the 
            sloped wind (i.e. taking into account both the vertical and horizontal 
            vector components). There is no need to specify a horizon angle image 
            when exposure to the horizontal wind component is calculated. Exposure 
            towards the sloped wind flux essentially combines the relative terrain 
            aspect and the maximum upwind slope (i.e. horizon angle). This terrain 
            attribute accounts for land-surface orientation, relative to the wind, 
            and shadowing effects of distant topographic features but does not 
            account for deflection of the wind by topography. This tool should not 
            be used on very extensive areas over which Earth’s curvature must be 
            taken into account.</p>

        <h2>Algorithm Description</h2>
        
        <p>Exposure is measured based on the equation presented in Antonic and 
            Legovic (1999):<br></p>
        
        <p><code><i>cos(E) = cos(S) sin(H) + sin(S) cos(H) cos(Az - A)</i></code></p>
        
        <p><br>Where, <i>E</i> is angle between a plane defining the local terrain 
            and a plane orthogonal to the wind flux, <i>S</i> is the terrain 
            slope, <i>A</i> is the terrain aspect, <i>Az</i> is the azimuth of 
            the wind flux, and <i>H</i> is the horizon angle of the wind flux, 
            which is zero when only the horizontal component of the wind flux is 
            accounted for.</p>
        
        <p><b><i>NoData</i></b> valued grid cells in the input image will be 
            assigned <b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the output image. The output 
            raster is of the <i>float</i> data type and <i>continuous</i> data 
            scale. Exposure images are best displayed using the blue-white-red
            bipolar palette to distinguish between the positive and negative 
            values that are present in the output.</p>
