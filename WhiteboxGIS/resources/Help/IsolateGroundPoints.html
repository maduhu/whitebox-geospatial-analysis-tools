        <h1>Isolate ground points (LiDAR)</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to filter out non-ground points in an input point cloud 
        dataset derived from laser scanning (LiDAR). The user must specifiy the input points file, 
        which can either be a ShapeFile of Point or MultiPoint base ShapeType or a LAS file. 
        The LAS file format is an industry standard format for storing data 
        acquired by laser scanners. If a ShapeFile is input, an attribute field containing the 
        elevation data (Z) must also be specified. The user must input the name of the output 
        ShapeFile. At present, the tool outputs a ShapeFile of MultiPointZ ShapeType and cannot output 
        a LAS file. The user must also specify the search distance, defining the radius of the 
        circular neighbourhood in which points are found, the minimum number of points, the 
        inter-point slope threshold, and whether the output file should be automatically displayed 
        when the tool has completed. If a search neighbourhood contains fewer than the 
        specified minimum number of points, its radius will be increased to that of the 
        smallest circle enclosing this minimum number of neighbours. </p>
        
        <p>The tool distinguishes ground points from non-ground points 
        based on the inter-point slope threshold. All of the points within the 
        circle encompassing each grid cell is then examined as a neighbourhood. All points within 
        a neighbourhood that have an inter-point slope with any other point and is also situated 
        above the corresponding point, is considered to be a non-ground point. An appropriate 
        value for the inter-point slope threshold parameter will depend on the steepness of the 
        terrain, but generally values of 15-35 degrees produce satisfactory results for flat to 
        moderatly flat areas. </p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                inputFile = wd + "input.las"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.shp"<br>
                searchDistance = "1.0"<br>
                minNeighbours = "0"<br>
                maxSlope = "20.0"<br>
                displayOutput = "false"<br>
                args = [inputFile, outputFile, searchDistance, minNeighbours, maxSlope, displayOutput]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("IsolateGroundPoints", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def inputFile = wd + "input.shp"<br>
                def elevField = "ELEV"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.shp"<br>
                def searchDistance = "1.0"<br>
                def minNeighbours = "0"<br>
                def maxSlope = "20.0"<br>
                def displayOutput = "false"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFile, elevField, outputFile, searchDistance, minNeighbours, maxSlope, displayOutput]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("IsolateGroundPoints", args, false)<br>
