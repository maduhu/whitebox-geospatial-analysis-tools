        <h1>Nearest-neighbour analysis</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to determine whether a distribution of vector points is 
        is significantly clustered or dispersed or if they are randomly distributed. It 
        is based on the calculation of the average distance of each point to its 
        nearest-neighbour (NN). The observed mean nearest-neighbour distance (<i>d<sub>o</sub></i>) 
        is then compared to the expected value (<i>d<sub>e</sub></i>):</p>

		<code><i>d<sub>e</sub></i> = 0.5 &#xd7; (<i>A</i> / <i>n</i>)<sup>0.5</sup> [eq. 1]</code>
		
	   <p>Where <i>A</i> is the area of the minimum bounding box (MBB) enclosing the points 
	   and <i>n</i> is the number of points. The nearest-neighbour ratio, defined as 
	   <code><i>d<sub>o</sub></i> / <i>d<sub>e</sub></i></code> , ranges from 0.0 for a distribution 
	   of coincident points, to 1.0 for a random point distribution, to a maximum of 2.15 for 
	   a hexagonal grid with maximal dispersion. Points that are situated along a regular square 
	   grid should have a NN ratio near 2. The analysis also includes a statistical testing for 
	   the significance of the computed <i>z</i>-score based on the standard error of the mean NN distance 
	   ((<i>s<sub>e</sub></i>)):</p>

	   <code><i>s<sub>e</sub></i> = 0.26136 / (<i>n</i> &#xd7; <i>n</i> / <i>A</i>)<sup>0.5</sup> [eq. 2]</code>

	   <p>The null hypothesis of this test is that the points are randomly distributed.</p>
	   
	   <p>Nearest-neighbour analysis is strongly affected by edge effects because points located at 
	   the edges of the extent may have their NN situated beyond the edge. To compensate for this 
	   bias, the data can optionally be tiled in a 3 &#xd7; 3 grid and the statistic is then calculated 
	   for the central area, a procedure recommended by Davis (2002) <i>Statistics and Data Analysis 
	   In Geology, 3rd Ed.</i> If the study area is anomolous within the larger region, the results of 
	   this analysis will be significantly influenced by edge effects.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                inputFile = wd + "input.shp"<br>
                edgeStrategy = "tile"<br>
                args = [inputFile, edgeStrategy]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("NearestNeighbourAnalysis", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def inputFile = wd + "input.shp"<br>
                def edgeStrategy = "nothing"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFile, edgeStrategy]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("NearestNeighbourAnalysis", args, false)<br>
            </code>
