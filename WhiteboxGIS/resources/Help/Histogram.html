<h1>Histogram</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to generate histogram data (i.e. data about the
statistical distribution) of the values in an image. Notice that the output of
this tool is text, which can be readily copied and pasted into a spreadsheet
program for graphing. The user must specify the size of the bins used to
aggregate the data. The default value is 1, however, this is heavily dependent
on the characteristic of the input image and should be adjusted accordingly. A
bin size that is too large will result in too few bins and therefore a poor
representation of the histogram. It is recommended that the range of values in
the image (determined by examining the display minimum and maximum values)
guide the setting of this parameter. The user can optionally specify the bin
starting and ending values. If these two parameters are not set, the algorithm
will assume values of the display minimum and maximum values. If the parameters
are set, any grid cells containing values either less than the starting bin or
higher than the ending bin, will not be included in the histogram. Thus,
setting these values can be an effective way of 1) ensuring logically-valued
bin ranges, and 2) excluding values that may represent undesirable extremes of
the statistical distribution.</p>

<p>The user may also optionally choose to have the cumulative probability
distribution (cpd) generated rather than the normal histogram. In this case,
the value assigned to each bin represents the cumulative probability. This is a
very useful function for comparing the statistical distributions of multiple
images.</p>

<p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the input image are ignored during the
generation of the histogram or cpd.</p>
