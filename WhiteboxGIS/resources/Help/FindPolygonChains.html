        <h1>Find polygon chains</h1>

        <p>The chain of polygons pattern is a characteristic pattern in which 
            elongated and aligned polygons are arranged end-to-end. This pattern 
            may arise because the lakes are confined to a fault line in the 
            underlying bedrock or are controlled by streamlined landforms. This 
            algorithm works by calculating the 
            <a href="MinimumBoundingBox.html"><b><i>Minimum Bounding Box</i></b></a> 
            (MBB) for each vector polygon. If the MBB is sufficiently elongated, 
            polygon end-points are identified for the feature. Each elongated 
            polygon has two end points, which were defined as the polygon nodes 
            nearest the two intersection points of the long-axis with the MBB. 
            A nearest-neighbour analysis is then performed on each polygon 
            end-point. End-points that are within a specified distance to the 
            end-point of another polygon feature are then analyzed to determine 
            if the two features are part of a chain. This involved comparing the 
            relative distances between the four end-points of the two polygons 
            and the lengths of the features. The tool can be made to only output 
            chains of a specified minimum number of polygons. A second vector 
            file can be optionally output to display the vector lines connecting 
            the polygons within identified chains.</p>
