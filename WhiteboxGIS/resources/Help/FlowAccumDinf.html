<h1>Dinf flow accumulation</h1>

<p>This tool is used to generate a flow accumulation grid (i.e. contributing
area) using the D-infinity algorithm (Tarboton, 1997). This algorithm is an
examples of a multiple-flow-direction (MFD) method because the flow entering
each grid cell is routed to one or two downslope neighbour, i.e. flow
divergence is permitted. The user must specify the name of the input
pointer-grid, which has been created either from the <i><b><a
href="FlowPointerDinf.html">Dinf</a></b></i> flow-pointer tool. The
flow-pointer grid should be created from a digital elevation model (DEM) that
has been hydrologically corrected to remove all spurious depressions and flat
areas. DEM pre-processing is usually achived using the <i><b><a
href="FillDeps.html">Fill Depressions</a></b></i> tool. </p>

<p>In addition to the input flow-pointer grid name, the user must specify the
output type. The output flow-accumulation can be 1) specific catchment area
(SCA), which is the upslope contributing area divided by the contour length
(taken as the grid resolution), 2) total catchment area in square-metres, or 3)
the number of upslope grid cells. The user must also specify whether the output
flow-accumulation grid should be log-tranformed, i.e. the output, if this
option is selected, will be the natural-logarithm of the accumulated area. This
is a transformation that is often performed to better visualize the
contributing area distribution. Because contributing areas tend to be very high
along valley bottoms and relatively low on hillslopes, when a flow-accumulation
image is displayed, the distribution of values on hillslopes tends to be
'washed out' because the palette is stretched out to represent the highest
values. Log-transformation provides a means of compensating for this
phenomenon. Importantly, however, log-transformed flow-accumulation grids must
not be used to estimate other secondary terrain indices, such as the <a
href="WetnessIndex.html">wetness index</a>, or <a
href="RelativeStreamPower.html">relative stream power index</a>. Perhaps a
better alternative to log-transformation of flow-accumulation values is to
increase the <i><b>'Palette non-linearity'</b></i> value under the <i><b>Layer
Properties</b></i> tab.</p>

<p>Grid cells possessing the <i><b>NoData</b></i> value in the input
flow-pointer grid are assigned the <i><b>NoData</b></i> value in the output
flow-accumlation image. The output raster is of the <i>float</i> data type and
<i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>
