<h1>Adaptive filter</h1>

<p>This tool performs a type of adaptive filter on a raster image. An adaptive
filter can be used to reduce the level of random noise (shot noise) in an
image. The algorithm operates by calculating the average value in a moving
window centred on each grid cell. If the absolute difference between the window
mean value and the centre grid cell value is beyond a user-defined threshold,
the grid cell in the output image is assigned the mean value, otherwise it is
equivalent to the original value. Therefore, the algorithm only modifies the
image where grid cell values are substantially different than their
neighbouring values.</p>

<p>Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is determined by the user-defined x and
y dimensions. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3,
5, 7, 9... The user may also define the neighbourhood shape as either
<b><i>squared</i></b> or <b><i>rounded</i></b>. A rounded neighbourhood
approximates an ellipse; a rounded neighbourhood with equal x and y dimensions
approximates a circle.</p>

<p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the input image are ignored during filtering.
When the neighbourhood around a grid cell extends beyond the edge of the grid,
<b><i>NoData</i></b> values are assigned to these sites. The output raster is
of the <i>float</i> data type and <i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>
