        <h1>Bare-Earth DEM (LiDAR)</h1>

        <p>This tool interpolates a bare-Earth digital elevation model (DEM) from one or more 
        input LAS files. The LAS file format is an industry standard format for storing data 
        acquired by laser scanners. The user must specify the name of one or more LAS files. 
        The output bare-Earth DEMs will have the same name as the corresponding input LAS file, 
        with specified file suffix appended to the end of the file name. The user must also 
        specify the grid resolution, the inter-point slope threshold, and optionally the 
        maximum scan angle deviation. The tool distinguishes ground points from non-ground points 
        based on the inter-point slope threshold. The interpolation area is divided into grid 
        cells, corresponding to the cells of the output DEM. All of the LiDAR points within the 
        circle encompassing each grid cell is then examined as a neighbourhood. All points within 
        a neighbourhood that have an inter-point slope with any other point and is also situated 
        above the corresponding point, is considered to be a non-ground point. An appropriate 
        value for the inter-point slope threshold parameter will depend on the steepness of the 
        terrain, but generally values of 15-35 degrees produce satisfactory results. The elevation 
        assigned to the grid cell is then the nearest ground point elevation.</p>

        <p>Importantly, this method of distinguishing non-ground points from terrain points does 
        not rely on any information about the point return (e.g. first versus last return). It is 
        therefore possible to derive a bare-Earth DEM for any LAS file, even those that do not 
        contain information about the point return. The technique has been shown to work very 
        well at creating bare-Earth DEMs even compared to interpolation using last-return points 
        only, as is the case with the <a href="LiDAR_IDW_Interpolation.html">IDW</a> and regular 
        <a href="LiDAR_NN_interpolation.html">nearest-neighbour</a> tools. The technique is 
        however <b><i>only useful for removing semi-transparent off-terrain objects</i></b> such 
        as vegetation and utilities lines. It will not remove buidings from the DEM. If the 
        area of coverage contains numerous buildings, it is advisable that the output of this 
        tool be further processed using the <a href="RemoveOffTerrainObjects.html">Remove 
        Off-Terrain Objects</a> tool to further remove all buildings. Also, if there are many 
        NoData holes within the resulting DEM, it may also be advisable to process the DEM 
        using the <a href="FillMissingDataHoles.html">Fill Missing Data Holes</a> tool.</p>
        
        <p>The maximum scan angle deviation parameter can be used to filter points from 
           the neighbourhood around each interpolated grid cell that have scan angles 
           that are larger than the neighbourhood minimum scan angle by this user-defined 
           threshold value. Large variation in the scan angle of nearby LiDAR points can 
           be common near the edges of scan lines. Although the effects of this are rarely 
           apparent in the DEM, the impact of using a collection of points with greatly 
           varying scan angles for interpolation can be observed in the derived products 
           of the DEM, particularly the hillshade image. This can significantly impact 
           modelled surface flowpaths in flight-line edge areas. Lowering the maximum 
           scan angle deviation parameter will have the impact of reducing this artifact. 
           If the parameter is set too low, however, the resulting interpolated surface 
           may contain extensive areas of NoData values. It is not recommended that this 
           parameter be set lower than 3.0 degrees. An appropriate value is however dependent 
           on the specific data set and can only be determined through experimentation. 
           If you do not want to exclude any points as a result of the variation of 
           scan angles within interpolation neighbourhoods, simply leave this parameter 
           blank (or 'not specified').</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>

                # be separated by semicolons in the string.<br>
                inputs = wd + "input1.las" + ";" + wd + "input2.las" + ";" + wd + "input3.las"<br>
