<h1>FD8 flow accumulation</h1>

<p>This tool is used to generate a flow accumulation grid (i.e. contributing
area) using the FD8 algorithm (Freeman, 1991). This algorithm is an examples of
a multiple-flow-direction (MFD) method because the flow entering each grid cell
is routed to each downslope neighbour, i.e. flow divergence is permitted. The
user must specify the name of the input digital elevation model(DEM). Notice that
unlike the other flow-accumulation tools, this tool does not require an input flow-pointer
grid. The DEM should be hydrologically corrected to remove all spurious depressions 
and flat areas before being input to this tool. DEM pre-processing is usually achived
using the <i><b><a href="FillDeps.html">Fill Depressions</a></b></i> tool. A
value must also be specified for the <i><b>exponent parameter</b></i>, a number
that controls the degree of dispersion in the resulting flow-accumulation grid.
A lower value yields greater apparent flow dispersion across divergent
hillslopes. Some experimentation suggests that a value of 1.1 is appropriate,
though this is almost certainly landscape-dependent.</p>

<p>In addition to the input DEM grid name and exponent, the user must
specify the output type. The output flow-accumulation can be 1) specific
catchment area (SCA), which is the upslope contributing area divided by the
contour length (taken as the grid resolution), 2) total catchment area in
square-metres, or 3) the number of upslope grid cells. The user must also
specify whether the output flow-accumulation grid should be log-tranformed,
i.e. the output, if this option is selected, will be the natural-logarithm of
the accumulated area. This is a transformation that is often performed to
better visualize the contributing area distribution. Because contributing areas
tend to be very high along valley bottoms and relatively low on hillslopes,
when a flow-accumulation image is displayed, the distribution of values on
hillslopes tends to be 'washed out' because the palette is stretched out to
represent the highest values. Log-transformation provides a means of
compensating for this phenomenon. Importantly, however, log-transformed
flow-accumulation grids must not be used to estimate other secondary terrain
indices, such as the <a href="WetnessIndex.html">wetness index</a>, or <a
href="RelativeStreamPower.html">relative stream power index</a>. Perhaps a
better alternative to log-transformation of flow-accumulation values is to
increase the <i><b>'Palette non-linearity'</b></i> value under the <i><b>Layer
Properties</b></i> tab.</p>

<p>The <i><b>non-dispersive threshold</b></i> is a flow-accumulation value
(measured in upslope grid cells, which is directly proportional to area) above
which flow dispersion is not longer permited. Grid cells with flow-accumulation
values above this threshold will have their flow routed in a manner that is
similar to the <i><b><a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8</a></b></i>
single-flow-direction algorithm, directing all flow towards the steepest
downslope neighbour. This is usually done under the assumption that flow
dispersion, whilst appropriate on hillslope areas, is not realistic once flow
becomes channelized.</p>

<p>Grid cells possessing the <i><b>NoData</b></i> value in the input
flow-pointer grid are assigned the <i><b>NoData</b></i> value in the output
flow-accumlation image. The output raster is of the <i>float</i> data type and
<i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>
