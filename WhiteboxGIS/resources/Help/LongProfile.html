<h1>Long profile</h1>

        <p>
		This tool can be used to create a long profile plot. A longitudinal stream profile 
		is a plot of elevation against downstream distance. Most long profiles use distance 
		from channel head as the distance measure. This tool, however, uses the distance 
		to the stream network outlet cell, or mouth, as the distance measure. The reason for this 
		difference is that while for any one location within a stream network there is only 
		ever one downstream outlet, there is usually many upstream channel heads. Thus plotted 
		using the traditional downstream-distance method, the same point within a network will 
		plot in many different long profile locations, whereas it will always plot on one unique 
		location in the distance-to-mouth method. One consequence of this difference is that 
		the long profile will be oriented from right-to-left rather than left-to-right, as 
		would traditionally be the case.</p>
		
		<p>The user must specify 
		the names of a D8 pointer image (flow direction) and a streams raster image. Stream 
		cells are designated in the streams image as all positive, nonzero values. Thus 
		all non-stream or background grid cells are commonly assigned either zeros or 
		NoData values. The pointer image is used to traverse the stream network and should 
		only be created using the <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 flow algorithm</a>. The 
		streams image should be derived using a flow accumulation based stream network 
		extraction algorithm, also based on the D8 flow algorithm. </p>

		<p>In addition to the output chart, the user may optionally specify the name of a 
		comma-separated value (*.csv) text file to output the profile to.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                pointerFile = wd + "D8 pointer.dep"<br>
                streams = wd + "streams.dep"<br>
                dem = wd + "DEM.dep"<br>
                args = [pointerFile, streams, dem]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("LongProfile", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def pointerFile = wd + "D8 pointer.dep"<br>
                def streams = wd + "stream.dep"<br>
                def dem = wd + "DEM.dep"<br>
                def outFile = wd + "profile.csv"<br>
                String[] args = [pointerFile, streams, dem, outFile]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("LongProfile", args, false)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
