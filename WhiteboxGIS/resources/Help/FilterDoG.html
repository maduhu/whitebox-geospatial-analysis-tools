<h1>Difference-of-Gaussians filter</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to perform a <b><i>difference-of-Gaussians filter</i></b> on a raster image. 
Difference-of-Gaussians is a feature (edge) enhancement filter that involves the subtraction of one smoothed 
version of an image from another less smoothed version of the image. The smoothed images are obtained by 
convolving the original image with <a href="FilterGaussian.html">Gaussian filters</a> with kernel weights 
determined by two differnt Gaussian distributions (i.e. different standard deviations). Smoothing an image 
using a Gaussian kernel suppresses only high-frequency spatial information. Subtracting one image from the 
other preserves spatial information that lies between the range of frequencies that are preserved in the 
two smoothed images. Thus, the difference-of-Gaussians is a band-pass filter (i.e. a filter that only passes 
frequencies within a certain range). </p>

<p>The algorithm operates by differencing the results of convolving two kernels of weights with each 
grid cell and its neighbours in an image. The weights of the convolution kernels are determined by 
the 2-dimensional Gaussian (i.e. normal) curve, which gives stronger weighting to cells nearer the kernel 
centre. The size of the two convolution kernels are determined by setting the two standard deviation 
parameters; the larger the standard deviation the larger the resulting filter kernel. The second standard 
devation should be a larger value than the first. Both standard deviations can range from 0.5-20.</p>

<p>The difference-of-Gaussians filter can be used to emphasize edges present in an image. Other edge 
sharpening filters also operate by enhancing high-frequency detail, but because random noise also has 
a high spatial frequency, many of these sharpening filters tend to enhance noise, which can be an undesirable 
artifact. The difference-of-Gaussians filter can remove high-frequency noise while emphasizing edges. 
This filter can, however, reduce overall image contrast.</p>

<p>The user may optionally choose to reflecting the data along image edges. <b><i>NoData</i></b> values in 
the input image are similarly valued in the output. The output raster is of the <i>float</i> data type 
and <i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>
