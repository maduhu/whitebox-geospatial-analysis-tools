        <h1>Single-parts to multi-parts</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to convert a vector file containing single-part features into 
        a vector containing multi-part features. The user has the option to either group features 
        based on an <b><i>ID Field</i></b>, which is a categorical field within the vector's attribute 
        table, or to group all features together into one large multi-part vector. If all features are 
        to be grouped then the ID Field should be set to <i>'merge all'</i>. This tool works for vectors 
        containing either point, line, or polygon features. Since shapefiles of a POINT ShapeType cannot 
        represent multi-part features, the ShapeType of the output file will be modified to a MULTIPOINT 
        ShapeType if the input file is of a POINT ShapeType. If the input vector is of a POLYGON ShapeType, 
        the user can optionally set the algorithm to search for polygons that should be represented as 
        hole parts. In the case of grouping based on an ID Field, hole parts are polygon features contained 
        within larger polygons of the same ID value. Please note that searching for polygon holes may 
        significantly increase processing time for larger polygon coverages.</p>

	   <p>To better understand the difference between multi-part and single-part vectors consider 
	   the following. The image below shows a vector coverage of Canada in which data are stored as a single 
	   record in a multi-part polygon. The attribute table only contains one entry.</p>
        
        <div>
        <img alt="Multi-part polygon" src="img/Cnd_multipart.png" />
        </div>
        
        <p>In comparison, the following vector stores features as many individual single-part polygons. Each 
        polygon is a seperate feature that possesses its own record in the attribute table.</p>
	   
        <div>
	   <img alt="Single-part polygon" src="img/Cnd_singlepart.png" />
	   </div>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                inputFile = wd + "polygons.shp"<br>
                idField = "CLASS_ID"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.shp"<br>
                searchForHoles = "true"<br>
                args = [inputFile, idField, outputFile, searchForHoles]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("SinglepartsToMultiparts", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def inputFile = wd + "lines.shp"<br>
                def idField = "merge all"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.shp"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFile, idField, outputFile]<br>
                // searchForHoles need not be specified because the input vector does not contain polygons.
                pluginHost.runPlugin("SinglepartsToMultiparts", args, false)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
