        <h1>Breach depressions (fast)</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to pre-process a digital elevation model (DEM) prior to being used for 
            hydrological analysis. It will remove topographic depressions and apparent dams in the DEM in 
            order to enforce continuous flow. This is achieved by breaching through topographic barriers.
            As such, depression breaching provides an alternative to <a href="FillDepressions.html">depression 
            filling</a>. Unlike depression filling, which has one unique solution for each depression 
            (filling algorithm differ by their approach rather than their solution), there may be several 
            competing solutions for depression breaching. The pathway of breach channel, connecting the 
            interior of topographic depression to a downslope neighbour, derived using this tool will 
            be based on the flood order. The flood order is the sequence of grid cells that are encountered 
            during a search, starting from the raster grid edges and the lowest grid cell, moving inward at 
            increasing elevations. This is in fact similar to how the highly efficient Wang and Liu (2006) 
            depression filling algorithm operates, except when a grid cell contained in a topographic 
            depression is encountered during the flood sequence, the algorithm works backwards along 
            the sequence until a lower cell is found, then the flow directions and elevations along 
            this pathway are updated to reflect the breach channel. The algorithm is also similar to the 
            depression breaching method described by Soille (2004).</p>
            
            <p>Importantly, the breach channels resulting from this method are not optimized to 
            reduce the degree to which the DEM must be modified to enforce flow, as is the case with 
            the <a href="BreachDepressions.html">Breach Depressions</a> tool. The Breach Depressions tool 
            is therefore superior in terms of the resulting solution compared with this algorithm. The 
            main drawback to that optimized solution is that it is extremely computationally expensive and 
            takes considerable time and computer resourses to complete. By comparison, the Breach Depressions 
            (Fast) algorithm is highly efficient, comparable in run time to the Wang and Liu (2006) filling 
            method. <b>Note that depression breaching, using any breaching approach, has been demonstrated 
            to reduce the impact on the DEM during the flow-enforcement step compared with depression 
            filling methods.</b> With the exception of well-type pit cells (i.e. single grid cells that are 
            anomolously lower than their neighbours), depression breaching will almost always remove 
            topographic depressions in a way reduces the loss of the surface flow information 
            contained in the original DEM compared with a filling solution. Depression filling is useful 
            as a technique for measuring the depth of topographic depression, but breaching-based methods are
            recommended for hydrological conditioning of DEMs prior to flow accumulation workflows. So then, 
            why do workers so commonly fill topographic depressions? One reason is the relative greater 
            availability of depression filling tools in GIS (many GIS only offer filling solutions). However, 
            another common reason is that compared with previously available breaching methods, there have 
            been many advances in making depression filling algorithm very fast. Well this tool is just 
            about as fast as Whitebox's depression filling tool. So now you have no excuse. <b>This tool 
            should be your default tool for hydrological processing of DEMs.</b> Its result is not as good 
            as the optimal breaching tool but it is far more efficient and still much better than filling. 
            Please breach!</p>
            
            <p>The user must specify the names of the input DEM and output files. The maximum breach length 
            (measured in pixels) parameter can optionally be set to limit the length of a breach channel. 
            Most breach channels will be relatively short (usually just a few grid cells in length). However, 
            when a pixel is quite a bit lower than all of its neighbouring cells, a much longer breach 
            path may be required to find a breaching solution. Notice that the Breach Depressions (Fast) tool 
            will raise the elevation of all very deep pit cells (so called wells) prior to breaching in an 
            attempt to lessen this effect. As such, the maximum breach length can generally be left blank. 
            If the maximum breach length parameter is not specified, the tool will remove every depression 
            contained in the original DEM. If however, a maximum breach length value is specified, some 
            depressions may still exist in the resulting DEM and other techniques (e.g. filling) may be 
            necessary to remove the remaining depressions.</p>

            <p>During the breaching process, the algorithm will keep track of flow-direction data in the 
            form of a <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 flow pointer grid</a>. This flow direction raster is
            commonly used in surface flowpath modelling workflows and therefore can be optionally output 
            from the operation of the breaching tool. The name of the flow-pointer grid will be the same 
            as the input DEM, with "_flow_pntr" appended to the end. Similarly, the user can also optionally 
            specify that the tool automatically use the flow direction raster to perform a 
            <a href="FlowAccumD8.html">D8 flow accumulation</a> (upslope catchment area) operation. The 
            resulting file will have a "_flow_accum" suffix.</p>

            <p>Please note that like the <a href="FillDepressions.html">Fill Depressions</a> tool, the 
            Breach Depressions (Fast) tool will read the entire DEM into memory, along with several 
            other grids. This the algorithm is not suited to processing massive DEMs except where the 
            user's computer has substantial memory (RAM) resources.</p>
