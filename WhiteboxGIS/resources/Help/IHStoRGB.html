        <h1>IHS to RGB</h1>
        <p>This tool transforms three intensity, hue, and saturation (IHS; 
            sometimes HSI or HIS) images raster images into three equivalent 
            multispectral images corresponding with the red, green, and blue channels
            of an RGB composite. <i>Intensity</i> refers 
            to the brightness of a color, <i>hue</i> is related to the dominant 
            wavelength of light and is perceived as color, and <i>saturation</i> is 
            the purity of the color (Koutsias et al. 2000 Photogrammetric 
            Engineering & Remote Sensing 66:7, 829-839). There are numerous 
            algorithms for performing a red-green-blue (RGB) to IHS transformation. 
            This tool uses the transformation described by Haydn (1982). Note that, 
            based on this transformation, the input IHS values <i>must follow the 
            ranges</i>:</p>

        <p><code>0 &#60; I &#60; 3<br>0 &#60; H &#60; 3<br>0 &#60; S &#60; 1</code></p>

        <p>The output red, green, and blue images will have values ranging from 
            0 to 255. The user must specify the names of the intensity, hue, 
            and saturation images. These images will generally be created using 
            the <a href="RGBtoIHS.html"><b><i>RGB to IHS</i></b></a> tool.
            The user must also specify the names of the output red, green, and 
            blue images. Image enhancements, such as contrast stretching, are 
            often performed on the individual IHS components, which are then 
            inverse transformed back in RGB components using this tool. The output 
            RGB components can then be used to create an improved color composite 
            image.</p>
