<h1>Percentile filter</h1>

<p>This tool performs a percentile filter on a raster image. Percentile filters
assigns each cell in the output grid the percentile (0% - 100%) that the grid
cell value is at within the cumulative distribution of values in a moving
window centred on each grid cell. This can be useful, for example, to determine
the local relief in the neighbourhood around each cell in a digital elevation
model (DEM). Because it requires sorting the values in the window, a
computationally intensive task, the percentile filter is considerably less
efficient than other smoothing filters. This may pose a problem for large
images or large neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is determined by the user-defined x and
y dimensions. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3,
5, 7, 9... The user may also define the neighbourhood shape as either
<b><i>squared</i></b>or <b><i>rounded</i></b>. A rounded neighbourhood
approximates an ellipse; a rounded neighbourhood with equal x and y dimensions
approximates a circle.</p>

<p><b><i>NoData</i></b>values in the input image are ignored during filtering.
When the neighbourhood around a grid cell extends beyond the edge of the grid,
<b><i>NoData</i></b>values are assigned to these sites. The output raster is of
the <i>float</i> data type and <i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>
